# Geospatial Vector Data 

1. Points: single (x, y) point

2. Lines: two or more connected (x, y) points

3. Polygon: three or more (x, y) points connected and closed

## Globe to Plane

What do we want to plot?

Globe - 3D Space

Where do we plot?

Computer screen or paper - 2D Space

To define the location of objects on the Earth, which is round, we need a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth’s shape.

---


# Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

- the way in which spatial data that represent the earth’s surface (which is round / 3 dimensional) are flattened so that you can “Draw” them on a 2-dimensional surface.

---

## Components of CRS

Coordinate system: X, Y grid to define a point located in space

Horizontal and vertical units

---

## Why multiple CRS?

To optimize to best represent the

shape and/or

scale / distance and/or

area

# Shapefile

- Vector data storage format for storing the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features

- A shapefile is made up of three required files with the same prefix ('spatial-data' in this case) but different extensions:

- spatial-data.shp: main file that stores records of each shape geometries

- spatial-data.shx: index of how the geometries in the main file relate to one-another

- spatial-data.dbf: attributes of each record

---

### CRS vs Shapefile

- Shapefiles contain geographic vector data that is expressed in a particular CRS
